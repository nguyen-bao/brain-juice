# Brain Juice
A personal project I created in high school. It is a compilation of minigames that train and track your brain on abilities like timing, reaction, and memory.

### Features
- 7 categories of minigames (x, x, x, x, x, x, x)
- 2 minigames in every category, each with 3 difficulties
- charts and graphs scores over time for each game
- user management (new user, delete user, clear scores, change name)

### Details
- developed in `Java 8`
- used `JavaFX` for GUI
- used `Timer` and `EventHandler` for minigames
- used `File I/O` for user save files

### Screenshots
`TBA`

### Status
January 2017 - May 2017 (Completed)

### Reflection
Brain Juice was my first real project in Java. I used the OOP knowledge I had acquired throughout my Computer Science program in high school to create something unique. The project was a great learning experience for me in creating a GUI, developing algorithms for minigames, and File I/O.
